Docudex is (going to be) a universal documentation manager for Linux/POSIX systems.
The idea is to be able to access *all* the documentation on your system - regardless
of whether it's a man page, an info page, HTML, PDF, whatever - with a single command.

The project will initially consist of a core library and two optional user interfaces.
The software is written in Rust.

Currently, this repo is just a placeholder for the project as a whole. All the
actual code is contained in the following repos (= Rust crates):

    docudex-core
    docudex-gtk
    docudex-nu
